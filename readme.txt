ACF extension for displaying ACF fields only on sticky posts edit screens.

You can use this extension to ACF to add a new custom location to the list of locations where ACF field groups can appear — sticky (or non-sticky) posts. Supports custom post types (you need a plugin such as Seamless Sticky Custom Post Types for that as well).

== Installation ==
Copy \'acf-location-sticky\' folder to your plugins directory.
